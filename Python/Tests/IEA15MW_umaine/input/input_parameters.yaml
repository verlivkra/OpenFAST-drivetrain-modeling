# Mass and stiffness proportional damping coefficients (Rayleigh Damping). 
# If set to "Calculate", will be calculated based on ElastoDyn tower stiffness proportional damping in traditional model, and user input on tower system freq and damping
RayleighCoffs: Calculate #List or "Calculate". "Calculate" only supported for floating, where only stiffness proportional damping is applied
# If RayleighCoffs is set to "Calculate", the user must provide the natural frequency and damping of the first system (coupled) tower natural frequency
